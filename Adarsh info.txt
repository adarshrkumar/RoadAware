State Government Fixing Roads (CalBike, CTC, & TransForm)
Non-profits like CalBike and TransForm are working to help fix road conditions in California by getting involved with communities and speaking up for changes.
* CalBike: The California Bicycle Coalition is all about making roads safer for cyclists. They want better bike lanes and work on fixing stuff like potholes and dangerous intersections. TADhey push for laws, like the Complete Streets policy, that try to make roads safer for everyone.
* TransForm: This group focuses on keeping roads in better shape and not just building new ones. They’re big on getting people to use public transportation instead of cars, which would help roads last longer, since fewer cars mean less wear and tear.
* TransForm: TransForm doesn’t just care about roads; they want to fix everything, like bridges and public transit, in a way that’s better for the environment. They make sure that the government is supporting projects that make it easier for people to walk, bike, or take the bus instead of driving.
* California Transportation Commission (CTC): The CTC is the one that decides where the money goes for fixing stuff like roads and bridges. They help choose which projects get funded, and that has a big impact on how things like roads and bridges get fixed up.
